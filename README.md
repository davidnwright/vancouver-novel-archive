# vancouver-novel-archive
Based on the art installation [*Vancouver Novel*](http://www.vancouverbiennale.com/artworks/vancouver-novel/) by João Loureiro. The repo holds the flat files for the exhibit that responds to João Loureiro's work by presenting an archive of photographs taken across 21 days. [The website](http://watchtheedge.ca/vancouver-novel-archive/) tries to key in on the randomness of Loureiro's narrative and challenge readers to think about the role that they play in shaping, or organizing, a narrative over time.
